Comments are fine down here because it only needs to read 12 elements.
Format is:
r	c
x	x...
x	x...
...

Note that values are tab-separated

For this particular initial grid state:
After first iteration:
1	0	0	0
1	1	0	0
1	0	0	0

After second iteration:
1	0	0	1
1	1	0	1
1	0	0	1

After third iteration:
0	0	0	0
0	1	0	0
0	0	0	0

After fourth iteration:
0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0

And the all-zeroes repeats for every iteration after that.
